## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Box-model
- media query
- viewport unit


### What I learned
I was able to use more complex CSS selectors.

I was able to use the viewport unit to control the width of the page for mobile devices.

### Continued development

I have not use flex or grid layouts, yet, in my challenge assignments. I probably want to take them up soon. However, I am still not 100% confident with the box model (and not at all with float), so I also want to gain more experience with it.

When there was a bug in my CSS and the style collapses, I could not refresh the view and get it working after fixing the bug. I had to close the page and re-open it to have the fix taken effect. Is it typical, or is there something in my code for the behavior?
